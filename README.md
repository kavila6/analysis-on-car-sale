## Key Highlights

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Calculated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, etc.)
- Created pivot tables and visualizations to answer business questions.

### Business Questions Explored
- Which product line had the most sales in 2004?
- Which region dominated in specific product lines (e.g., Classic Cars in Canada)?

### Forecasting
- Used monthly 2003 data to forecast sales for Q1 2004.
- Applied linear trendlines and Excel’s Forecast Sheet to predict 2005 Classic Car sales.

### Scenario Modeling
- Modeled different business conditions with Scenario Manager (e.g., varying pricing and quantities).
- Analyzed results to support sales strategy decisions.

## Limitations
- Sales = QuantityOrdered × PriceEach was not reliable for all data entries.
- Missing metadata limited deeper contextual understanding.
